## OpenC2 Design Constructs

Design constructs are used to facilitate and document decisions made by the working group.  Online, electronic discussions will be conducted through the [Issues](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-working-group/issues) functionality.  If you have something to propose, follow this process:

**FIRST**:

[Add an issue](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-working-group/issues/new) to describe the identified PROBLEM and a POTENTIAL SOLUTION.  Adding an _issue_ will initiate a discussion.  Solicit members of the working group for affirmative and negative constructs.

**SECOND**:

When the discussion is sufficiently mature and a majority opinion has been achieved, document it with a **Design Construct**.

1. Prepare a design construct using the provided [template](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-working-group/blob/master/constructs/_construct-template.dotx?raw=true).
2. Describe the proposal and provide bullets for the affirmative and negative constructs.  Solicit members active in the discussion to help with constructs and rebuttal statements.
3. Provide draft construct to the working group.  The OpenC2 forum will determine the resolution and minority reports.


The following table lists the design constructs and their current status.  Click on the title of the design construct to open the construct document.  Click on the status to go to the discussion area within _Issues_.
