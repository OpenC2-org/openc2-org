## Design Constructs

Design constructs are used to document decisions made by the working group.  Online, electronic discussions will be conducted through the [Issues](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-working-group/issues).  If you have something to propose, follow this process:

1. Prepare a design construct using the provided document template.
2. [Add an issue](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-working-group/issues/new) with the title "CONSTRUCT: \<insert title\>"

The following table lists the design constructs and their current status.  Click on the title of the design construct to open the construct document.  Click on the status to go to the discussion area within _Issues_.
