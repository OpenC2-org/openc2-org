## Design Constructs

Design constructs are used to document decisions made by the working group.  Online, electronic discussions will be conducted through the [Issues](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-working-group/issues).  If you have something to propose, follow this process:

1. Prepare a design construct using the provided document template.
2. [Add an issue](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-working-group/issues/new) with the title "CONSTRUCT: \<insert title\>"

The following table lists the design constructs and their current status.
