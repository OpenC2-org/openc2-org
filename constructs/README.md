## OpenC2 Design Constructs

Design constructs are used to facilitate and document decisions made by the working group.  Online, electronic discussions will be conducted through the [Issues](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-working-group/issues) functionality.  If you have something to propose, follow this process:

1. [Add an issue](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-working-group/issues/new)  with the title "CONSTRUCT: \<insert title\>".
2. Describe the proposal and provide the initial bullets for the affirmative and negative constructs.
3. Solicit members of the working group for additional bullets.
4. Prepare a design construct using the provided [template](https://github.com/OpenC2-org/openc2-working-group/blob/master/constructs/_construct-template.dotx?raw=true).
5. Segregate the bullets collected in step 2 as constructs or rebuttal statements.
6. Provide draft construct to the working group.  The OpenC2 forum will determine the resolution and minority reports.


The following table lists the design constructs and their current status.  Click on the title of the design construct to open the construct document.  Click on the status to go to the discussion area within _Issues_.
