Use this short read me to understand how we stood up an openc2 proxy...

In order to process an OpenC2 Command the team stood up a DJANGO server which provides a RESTful API to post OpenC2 commands.

- The zip file OpenC2Proxy_Django_Server.zip contains all of the configuration files required in order to stand up this server.

- In order to start the DJANGO web server just execute the startOpenC2Proxy.bat.
