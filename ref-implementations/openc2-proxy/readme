Use this short read me to understand how we stood up an openc2 proxy...

In order to process an OpenC2 Command the team stood up a DJANGO server which provides a RESTful API to post OpenC2 commands.

- The zip file OpenC2Proxy_Django_Server.zip contains all of the configuration files required in order to stand up this server.

- In order to start the DJANGO web server just execute the startOpenC2Proxy.bat. This batch file has a bookmark located on the Windows 
  'Desktop' of our test vm. This batch file is not a standard part of a DJANGO configuration, it was provided as a means to bring the 
  server up without having to memorize command line instructions.

- A template OVF for the Windows vm that we used can be found under \DMCC_Monitor\FollowOnWork\OpenC2\RefArch\VM Backups\ on a 'share'
  located at our lab.
