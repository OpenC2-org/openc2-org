Phantom Cyber configuration for connecting to our OpenC2Proxy. Also included is the 'Custom REST handler'.  

The stix_20_coa_handler.py allows our Phantom Cyber Forwarder to send STIX 2.0 COA's to this server
for conversion to OpenC2 Commands. The OpenC2 Proxy then uses the OpenC2 Proxy connector to send it to the OpenC2 Proxy.
