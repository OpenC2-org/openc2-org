#JSON Abstract Encoding Notation

JSON Abstract Encoding Notation (JAEN, pronounced Jane) is a JSON document
format for defining abstract schemas.  Unlike concrete schema languages
such as XSD and JSON Schema, JAEN defines the structure of datatypes
independently of the serialization used to communicate or store data objects.

Note: The following changes were made based on feedback from the 29 September
OpenC2 Forum meeting:

1. Change name to JAEN to avoid phonetic confusion with JSON
2. Add "Description" column to structure definitions
3. Change "Options" column from string to list of strings
